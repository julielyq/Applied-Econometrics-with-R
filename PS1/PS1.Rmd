t.test(ahe_1992_adjusted_highschool, ahe_2012_highschool, paired = FALSE, alternative = "less", var.equal = FALSE, mu = 0)
```
The p-value is 1, which is far greater than 0.05(5%), so we reject the null hypothesis that there is no change between real wages of high school graduates from 1992 to 2012. Therefore, real (inflation-adjusted) wages of high school graduates increase from 1992 to 2012(alternative hyphothesis).
```{r}
# ii.
t.test(ahe_1992_adjusted_bachelor, ahe_2012_colledge ,paried = FALSE, alternative = "less", var.equal = FALSE, mu = 0)
```
The p-value is 0.2, which is greater than 0.05(5%), so we reject the null hypothesis that there is no change between real wages of colledge graduates from 1992 to 2012. Therefore, real (inflation-adjusted) wages of colledge graduates increase from 1992 to 2012(alternative hyphothesis).

```{r}
# iii.
gap_1992 =  ahe_1992_adjusted_bachelor - ahe_1992_adjusted_highschool

t.test(gap_1992, gap_2012, paried = FALSE, alternative = "greater", var.equal = FALSE)
```
The p-value is 1, which is far greater than 0.05(5%), so we reject the null hypothesis that there is no change gap between earnings of college and high school graduates. Therefore, gap between earnings of college and high school graduates increases(alternative hyphothesis).

There are notable difference between the results for high school and college graduates.First, we can clearly tell that the hourly wage for college graduates is larger than the hourly wage for high shool graduates. In both cases for colledge graduates and high school graduates, wage for male is greater than wage for female. For 1992, the difference in average wage for male and female who are colledge graduates is 3.44, which is greater than the difference in average wage for male and female who are high shool graduates(2.02). However, for 2012, the difference in average wage for male and female who are colledge graduates is 3.80, which is less than the difference in average wage for male and female who are high shool graduates(3.88). 



# EE4.1 - Problem 6
## --- a ---
```{r}
plot <- ggplot(growth, aes(x = tradeshare, y = growth)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "Share of Trade", y = "Growth") 
plot # display plot
```

Based on the scatter plot above, it appears that there is a positive relationship between growth and tradeshare. As tradeshare increases, growth increases.

## --- b ---
```{r}
plot_withMarlainred <- ggplot(growth, aes( x = tradeshare, y = growth)) + geom_point() + geom_point(data=growth[growth$country_name == "Malta",],color="red",size=2) + labs(x = "Share of Trade", y = "Growth") 
plot_withMarlainred # display plot
```

Malta is the red point on the scatter plot on the upper right coner of the graph. It look like an outlier because it's far distant from the other data (black points in graph).

## --- c ---
```{r}
reg <- lm(growth$growth ~ growth$tradeshare)
names(reg$coefficients) <- c("(Intercept)", "slope")
print("Regression Summary");
summary(reg) 
```
```{r}
0.64 + 2.306*0.5
0.64 + 2.306*1
```

The estimated slope is 2.306, and the estimated intercept is 0.64. When trade share is 0.5, the predicted growth rate for a country is  1.79. When trade share is 1, the predicted growth rate for a country is 2.95.

## --- d ---
```{r}
growth_new <- growth[!growth$country_name == "Malta",]
reg_withoutMalta <- lm(growth_new$growth ~ growth_new$tradeshare)
names(reg_withoutMalta$coefficients) <- c("(Intercept)", "slope")
print("Regression Summary");
summary(reg_withoutMalta) 
```
```{r}
0.957 + 1.681*0.5
0.957 + 1.681*1
```

The estimated slope is 1.681, and the estimated intercept is 0.957.  When trade share is 1.8, the predicted growth rate for a country is  1.79. When trade share is 1, the predicted growth rate for a country is 2.64.

## --- e ---
```{r}
plot_withregression <- plot + stat_smooth(method = "lm", fullrange = TRUE, size = 1.5, level=0)
plot_withregression + labs(title = "Growth vs. Share of Trade (with all data)")
```

```{r}
plot_withregression_withoutMarla <- ggplot(growth_new, aes(x = tradeshare, y = growth)) + geom_point()+ stat_smooth(method = "lm", fullrange = TRUE, size = 1.5, level=0) + labs(title = "Growth vs. Share of Trade (without Marla)" , x = "Share of Trade", y = "Growth") 
plot_withregression_withoutMarla
```

The regression function that includes Malta is steeper than the regression function that excludes Malta, because the tradesare value for Malta is extremely high. This outlier wil drive up the slop of regression. 

## --- f ---
Malta is an island in the central Mediterranean between Sicily and the North African coast. The island a freight trans-shipment point. As a result, there are large amount of goods get shipped to Malta and get shipped out of Malta, leading to higher total number of import and export. In turn, the high sum of impot and export leads to large value of trade share. As an outlier, it should be excluded from the analysis.
